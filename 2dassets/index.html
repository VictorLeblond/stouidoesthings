            This section shows 2D assets that I made for games, some for fun, some for unfinished projects.

            These assets were for a game I worked on in 2018-2019. The game was an roguelike bullethell action rpg similar to Enter The Gungeon.<br>
            This project, even unfinished, means a lot to me as it was a turning point into my pixel art style. I was able to learn a lot and touch <br>
            many aspects of making assets for a 2D game (Characters, Tilemaps, etc...)<br>
            Being 16 at the time, I had to stop working on the project as the scope of it was very big and I was working on it solo.<br>
            There is a workable version of the game, all the mechanics are implemented, so I may come back to it and polish it.
