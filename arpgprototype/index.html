        This is a small project presenting a 3C (character, control, camera). I've tried replicating a dark souls / WoW character controller.<br>
        The core of the project was made in april 2021 and I polished it in March 2024 to make it presentable. Polishing included : bug fixing,<br> UI sprites and sounds.
        It was a very good learning experience as I was able to learn useful parts present is these types of games like :<br>
        - An inventory system
        - Animation based combat
        - Enemy pathfinding
        - 3D asset making<br>

        The game started as a moba-like game style, where you click at the position you want to go and the player follows a path to this destination.
        You can find a downloadable version of the game here :
