        <div class="standard-paragraph">This is a small project presenting a 3C (character, control, camera). I've tried
            replicating a dark souls / WoW character controller.
            The core of the project was made in april 2021 and I polished it in March 2024 to make it presentable.
            Polishing included : bug fixing, UI sprites and sounds.
            It was a very good learning experience as I was able to learn useful parts present is these types of games
            like : Enemy pathfinding, Inventory system, Animation based combat, Abilities/spells and 3D asset
            making<br><br></div>
        <div class="grid-container2x2">
            <div class="grid-item">
                <div class="standard-paragraph" style="text-align: left;">The game started as a moba-like game style,
                    where you click at the position you want to go and the
                    player follows a path to this destination.
                    That required coding a pathfinding system. Luckily, the A* Pathfinding project made by Arongran Berg
                    provides a very well made and strong system. I simply built upon it with
                    scripts handling player destination (inputs), calculating the path throught the A* algorithm and
                    following it with a controller.<br><br>
                    I wasn't satisfied with the way the player moved, so I implemented it on the enemy and gave the
                    player a
                    standard WASD platformer-like
                    controller.</div>
            </div>

        </div><br><br>
        <div class="grid-container2x2">
            <div class="grid-item"><img class="grid-image" src="Items.gif"></div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <div class="standard-paragraph" style="text-align: right;">I also implemented an inventory system with
                    slots,
                    this demo features a single slot for weapon. But the
                    system
                    can handle multiple types of
                    equippables (helmet, boots, etc...). The biggest challenge in these kind of systems, for me, is
                    handling
                    inputs
                    (drag/drop) and having a
                    flexible enough data structure to create new items easily. Luckily, unity provides an efficient
                    Event
                    System and
                    Scriptable Objects to deal
                    with these challenges easily. <br><br>The game has an ability system that works very similarly to
                    the inventory
                    sytem. Every spell can be coded and introduced into the system easily.

                <div class="standard-paragraph" style="text-align: left;">Next, the most time consuming part of this
                    project
                    was handling animaton and player states (idle, running,
                    attacking, etc..). My system
                    can easily be approved, and I made a lot of back and fort unity-blender as I couldn't find an
                    efficient
                    approach
                    to creating attack combos
                    animation like in Dark Souls. It involves multiples states where depending on the player's input,
                    you
                    either
                    continue the combo or go back to
                    idle slowly. <br><br>Anyway, it was very tedious and unintuitive to implement and if I had to do it
                    again I
                    would
                    put
                    more time into
                    making an animation controller handling what animation plays when, for how long and which is next...

            <div class="grid-item">
                <div class="standard-paragraph" style="text-align: right;">A huge part of making this was creating all
                    the assets
                    necessary
                    for this scene. I was not familiar
                    with low-poly style
                    asset creation and I learned a lot about the fundementals of making 3D assets. I was finally able to
                    develop
                    a
                    workflow and create
                    consistent assets that I liked.</div>

                    It was also my first time dealing with sounds in a 3D environment. Unity has a built-in sound system
                    and all I had to do was to create a sound manager script that decides what plays when. <br><br>
                    I made the sounds and music in VCV Rack, a free open-source virtual modular synthesizer. I don't
                    consider myself as a musicians by any means, but I believe what I was able to come up with
                    is pretty decent. Here's a snippet of how it behaves in the software :
