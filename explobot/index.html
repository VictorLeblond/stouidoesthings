                Explobot is a game I started during a weekend of Febuary 2023. I polished it during the summer of 2023.
                <br>
                <br>
                My goal for the project was to have a complete but simple game within a short period of time.
                <br>
                The game is about a little robot going up to plug himself as he is running out of battery. It's played
                using only the mouse.
                <br>
                You can play the game <a class="links" href="../explobot/play/">here</a>
                <br>
                You can find the assets <a class="links" href="../explobot/ExploBotAssets">here</a>.
